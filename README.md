# Waste Tax Incidence Model
This repository contains a general modeling framework for analyzing household-level tax incidence and welfare effects under a per-unit taxation scheme. The framework is policy-agnostic and intended to demonstrate analytical structure rather than produce any case-specific conclusions.
___
## Project Assumptions & Rules

### 1. Policy Structure

- The policy under consideration is a per-unit tax levied on individual waste generation
- Individual waste production is assumed to be perfectly measured and directly attributable
- The tax is applied uniformly per unit of waste, with no tiering, exemptions, or thresholds
- Conglomerate waste production is attributed to and incurrred as an expense to the company

### 2. Population and Scope

- The modeled population consists of heterogeneous households uniquely differentiated by income and baseline consumption
- The analysis is contextualized to the United States for interpretability and ease of access public data
- Government revenue is treated as lump-sum recyclable unless otherwise specified
- The framework abstracts from cross-border, state-level, or jurisdictional variation and assumes uniform implementation

### 3. Behavioral Responses

- Households are assumed to be rational and forward-looking within the modeled horizon
- Waste generation is assumed to be an increasing function of consumption, with elasticity as some function of income
- Behavioral responses occur through consumption adjustment and waste-reduction effort; preferences are stable over the analysis horizon

### 4. Time Horizon

- The analysis focuses on short- to medium-run responses to preserve contextual correlation
- Capital adjustment, technological change, and long-run innovation are held fixed

### 6. Data and Calibration

- Any data included in this repository is publicly available at an aggregate level
___
## Important Notes - 

- This repository contains a **sanitized and illustrative version** of the analytical framework. All data, parameters, and outputs that could be tied to a specific application or case have been removed or replaced with placeholders or synthetic examples.

- A private repository containing full datasets, data-cleaning code, and intermediate analysis exists and **can be shared upon request** for methodological clarification.
