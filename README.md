# Waste Tax Incidence Model
This repository contains a general modeling framework for analyzing household-level tax incidence and welfare effects under a per-unit taxation scheme. The framework is policy-agnostic and intended to demonstrate analytical structure rather than produce any case-specific conclusions.

## Project Assumptions - 

+ In terms of data analysis and collection, I will assume that this policy is being implemented in the United States. This is a choice made for ease of context, relevancy, and availible sourcing of data.
+ 'Literal Interpretation': I will for the sake of continuity take the literal interpretation of
>"each individual’s production of waste is accurately measured, and everyone is taxed based on the amount of waste they generate," 

<sub>i.e. there will be no consideration of work-arounds, demographic specific 'rebates', or inefficiencies within the policy. This does not exclude it's mention and/or later exploration, only its inclusion in the primary hypothesis.</sub>
+ Finally, we will assume the uniformity of policy implementation, 'spatial homogeneity', no cross- border, state, or any other non-distinct boundary implementation differences.
+ The analysis given will focus on short- to medium-run behavioral and fiscal responses, holding technology and preferences as a constant.
