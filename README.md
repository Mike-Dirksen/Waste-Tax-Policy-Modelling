# 2026_Case_Study
This project examines a waste-based taxation policy where individuals are taxed according to the amount of waste they produce. It aims to analyze how precise measurement could shift consumption behavior, reduce overproduction, and create new incentives, while also considering equity concerns and unintended behavioral responses.
___
## Project Assumptions - 

+ In terms of data analysis and collection, I will assume that this policy is being implemented in the United States. This is a choice made for ease of context, relevancy, and availible sourcing of data.
+ 'Literal Interpretation': I will for the sake of continuity take the literal interpretation of
>"each individual’s production of waste is accurately measured, and everyone is taxed based on the amount of waste they generate," 

<sub>i.e. there will be no consideration of work-arounds, demographic specific 'rebates', or inefficiencies within the policy. This does not exclude it's mention and/or later exploration, only its inclusion in the primary hypothesis.</sub>
+ Finally, we will assume the uniformity of policy implementation, 'spatial homogeneity', no cross- border, state, or any other non-distinct boundary implementation differences.
+ The analysis given will focus on short- to medium-run behavioral and fiscal responses, holding technology and preferences as a constant.
