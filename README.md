# Waste Tax Incidence Model
This repository contains a general modeling framework for analyzing household-level tax incidence and welfare effects under a per-unit taxation scheme. The framework is policy-agnostic and intended to demonstrate analytical structure rather than produce any case-specific conclusions.
___
## Project Assumptions

- **Geographic scope:** The analysis is contextualized to the United States for ease of interpretation and access to publicly available, high-level data sources.

- **Literal policy interpretation:** For analytical clarity, the framework adopts a literal interpretation of a per-unit waste tax in which individual waste generation is accurately measured and taxed accordingly.  
  <sub> - This intentionally excludes behavioral workarounds, demographic-specific rebates, and administrative inefficiencies from the primary analysis, while allowing for their discussion as extensions.</sub>

- **Uniform implementation:** The policy is assumed to be implemented uniformly across space, with no cross-border, state-level, or jurisdictional differences (“spatial homogeneity”).

- **Time horizon:** The analysis focuses on short- to medium-run behavioral and fiscal responses, holding technology and preferences fixed.

## Important Notes - 

- This repository contains a **sanitized and illustrative version** of the analytical framework. All data, parameters, and outputs that could be tied to a specific application or case have been removed or replaced with placeholders or synthetic examples.

- A private repository containing full datasets, data-cleaning code, and intermediate analysis exists and **can be shared upon request** for methodological clarification.
